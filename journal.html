Hi journal!! So far I have just finished making the main page of my website and pushing it online. It was pretty easy to push the website but making it took me really long because I couldn't get the placement of the clouds to look how I wanted it to. I ended up looking up different ways to place objects in CSS and found one called “float” that worked super well! I really like how it turned out but I want to figure out how to make the page look better on different screen sizes (like your phone or in split screen)- I ran into some issues when coding because the formatting of my website would change depending whether it was split screen or not.

Hi journal! I just finished making a function for my code sketch and it records the x and y coordinate of where you click. I’m not entirely sure what I want to make my codesketch but I think I want to figure out a way to make the cherries in my codesketch move to where you click and make the background image an ice cream so that it looks like you are decorating an ice cream cone!

Hi journal! These are the things I’ve learned so far: 
<div></div>
-Javascript
<div></div>
-Use an eventListener to collect info to use for a function (ex. Where the mouse is on the screen)
<div></div>
-Var is used to define terms in javascript (Ex. let blahblah= something you previously coded)
<div></div>
-A function is something that performs a task by using info from an event listener and doing something with it
<div></div>
-CSS
	<div></div>
-A language in comp sci that is super helpful for layout/ design
<div></div>
-HTML
	<div></div>
	-I know that HTML is used to set up formatting and is put at the top of your code but I don’t understand exactly it does
<div></div>
-Terminal 
<div></div>
	-Terminal can be used to access different levels of your computer and I used it to push my website 
	<div></div>
-Console
<div></div>
	-Can be used to check if your functions are working and will point out errors in your code
	<div></div>
-Github
<div></div>
	-Github is used to publish websites
<div></div>
<div></div>
Questions I have:
<div></div>
-Why can’t you do the same things in CSS as JavaScript?
<div></div>
-What is the difference between the console and terminal?
<div></div>
-How can you move existing divisions using JavaScript? 
<div></div>
-What things can JavaScript not do and what other coding languages do you need to use to do what JavaScript can’t?

Today I went back and tried to fix my first codesketch and make my projects and journal link from my website but I still can't figure out how to make my first codesketch work so I made a lab with Molly for Wednesday. Other than that I restyled my journal and made it more organized because the formating before was a little confusing and coded my projects page!

Hi journal! Today I coded my aray codesketch (an array is when a var is assigned multiple values rather than just one). I decided to make an eventListener that listens for mouseclick and then generates a random number from 0-7. From there it assigns the number value a picture which I chose to make different Community characters!

<div class="journalentry"> 4.23.21
Today I made a for loop which is when you can make a sequence of code than is repeated a certain number of times (in a "loop"). I made a cupcake timer by styling a cupcake div and creating a for loop that makes another cupcake and I set the timer by using set interval!
</div>
<div class="divspace"></div>
<div class="journalentry"> 5.9.21
I was a little confused about how to use for loops so I made a Mother's Day codesketch for my Mom using a for loop! Specifically I didn't understand how the function knew how many divs to make- but I looked over my last for loop code sketch and realized that the "for(var i=0; i<1; i = i+1)" part of my code controlled the amount of divs made each time the function was called. For my codesketch I wrote a little message at the top and took a png of confetti to put into my for loop so it looked like confetti was falling and then called the function by using setInterval so another confetti png would appear every 100 milliseconds. 
<div></div>
p.s: A for loop is essentially a way to repeatedly create divs without needing to individually code each one (it's super helpful when you want to make a ton of the same thing)

<div class="journalentry"> 5.16.21
Today I coded an if then code sketch that switches between two different emojis. An if then/ coditional statement can be used to have the same event listener do two different things, for ex. in my code I said that if the number of clicks divided by 2 = 0 (even) it would be one image and if the number of clicks divided by 2 had a remainder of one (odd) it would be a different image. I also started brainstorming ideas for my presentation!

	Today I worked on my presentation and cleaned up my projects page (the formatting was kinda weird). Nothing much right now!

Hey journal! 
<div></div>
This is my last entry so it’s time to say goodbye :( I’ve really enjoyed compsci this year and I’m excited to learn more in the future! Starting out this year I had no idea how to code and had a lot of trouble figuring out how to tweak my websites and come up with ideas. As the year went on, I got a lot better at problem solving and figuring out things on my own. It’s also become easier for me to come up with an idea for a codesketch! I really like some of the things I made- especially some of my more recent codesketche- but I wish I had had more time to add on to some of the earlier ones. I think if we focused on individual codesketches for a little longer it might have helped me better pick up concepts, but I really liked coding along with Molly in class and learning different functions there! Nonetheless, I know how to make a website now which is something I have always wanted to do! In the future I want to use some of my knowledge from CS1 to create websites to help with causes or create petitions. To students next year I would say you should try to stay on top of journal entries and codesketches to the best of your ability! At the beginning of this year I didn’t know how often I was supposed to journal so I didn’t write any of my thoughts down which would have been really fun to see. As for codesketches, I still have an early one that is unfinished because I never figured out how to make it, so I would say try to make labs or ask your friends if you can’t figure out how to make something work! It’s also helpful to look at other people’s websites if they have done similar things!! 
<div></div>
Okay journal, that’s about it!
<div></div>
Bye!!
