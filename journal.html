Hi journal!! So far I have just finished making the main page of my website and pushing it online. It was pretty easy to push the website but making it took me really long because I couldn't get the placement of the clouds to look how I wanted it to. I ended up looking up different ways to place objects in CSS and found one called “float” that worked super well! I really like how it turned out but I want to figure out how to make the page look better on different screen sizes (like your phone or in split screen)- I ran into some issues when coding because the formatting of my website would change depending whether it was split screen or not.

Hi journal! I just finished making a function for my code sketch and it records the x and y coordinate of where you click. I’m not entirely sure what I want to make my codesketch but I think I want to figure out a way to make the cherries in my codesketch move to where you click and make the background image an ice cream so that it looks like you are decorating an ice cream cone!

Hi journal! These are the things I’ve learned so far: 
<div></div>
-Javascript
<div></div>
-Use an eventListener to collect info to use for a function (ex. Where the mouse is on the screen)
<div></div>
-Var is used to define terms in javascript (Ex. let blahblah= something you previously coded)
<div></div>
-A function is something that performs a task by using info from an event listener and doing something with it
<div></div>
-CSS
	<div></div>
-A language in comp sci that is super helpful for layout/ design
<div></div>
-HTML
	<div></div>
	-I know that HTML is used to set up formatting and is put at the top of your code but I don’t understand exactly it does
<div></div>
-Terminal 
<div></div>
	-Terminal can be used to access different levels of your computer and I used it to push my website 
	<div></div>
-Console
<div></div>
	-Can be used to check if your functions are working and will point out errors in your code
	<div></div>
-Github
<div></div>
	-Github is used to publish websites
<div></div>
<div></div>
Questions I have:
<div></div>
-Why can’t you do the same things in CSS as JavaScript?
<div></div>
-What is the difference between the console and terminal?
<div></div>
-How can you move existing divisions using JavaScript? 
<div></div>
-What things can JavaScript not do and what other coding languages do you need to use to do what JavaScript can’t?

Today I went back and tried to fix my first codesketch and make my projects and journal link from my website but I still can't figure out how to make my first codesketch work so I made a lab with Molly for Wednesday. Other than that I restyled my journal and made it more organized because the formating before was a little confusing and coded my projects page!

Hi journal! Today I coded my aray codesketch (an array is when a var is assigned multiple values rather than just one). I decided to make an eventListener that listens for mouseclick and then generates a random number from 0-7. From there it assigns the number value a picture which I chose to make different Community characters!

Today I made a for loop which is when you can make a sequence of code than is repeated a certain number of times (in a "loop"). I made a cupcake timer by styling a cupcake div and creating a for loop that makes another cupcake and I set the timer by using set interval!

I was a little confused about how to use for loops so I made a Mother's Day codesketch for my Mom using a for loop! Specifically I didn't understand how the function knew how many divs to make- but I looked over my last for loop code sketch and realized that the "for(var i=0; i<1; i = i+1)" part of my code controlled the amount of divs made each time the function was called. For my codesketch I wrote a little message at the top and took a png of confetti to put into my for loop so it looked like confetti was falling and then called the function by using setInterval so another confetti png would appear every 100 milliseconds. 
<div></div>
p.s: A for loop is essentially a way to repeatedly create divs without needing to individually code each one (it's super helpful when you want to make a ton of the same thing)
